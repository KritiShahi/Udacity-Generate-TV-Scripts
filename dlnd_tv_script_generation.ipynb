I wanted to reduce the number of steps in epoch so increased the batch_size to 128 but I got a CUDA memory error. I searched on the net to resolve the problem and found that it is advisable to train on small batches when we encounter this type of error. Changed the batch_size back to 32 and changed sequence length to 200 but had a thought of reducing the number of steps in the epoch so changed the batch_size to 64 and sequence length back to 100. The number of steps in an epoch reduced from 54 to 27. I again increased the batch size to 128 and the sequence length to 100 which reduced the number of steps from 27 to 13 and got a training loss of 9.92 at epoch 5.By changing the hidden_dim to 128, I got training loss of 9.39 at epoch 7. I experimented with different hyperparameters like by increasing the hidden_dim to 256, number of layers to 3,embedding_dim to 300 one by one and keeping other hyperparameters constant but couldn't get the desired results. I even experimented with learning rates and then read some answers on knowledge hub. Training loss started decreasing with decrease in sequence length. I tried with different sequence like 50, 20 and 10.
